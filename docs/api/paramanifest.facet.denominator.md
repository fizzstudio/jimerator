## Facet.denominator property

If the units for this facet of the chart are fractional, then this is the denominator of that fraction. For example: '(per) capita', '(per) million inhabitants'. If this property is present, then every series on the chart must measure a fractional quantity, of which this will also be the denominator.

**Signature:**

```typescript
denominator?: string;
```
